I slipped on the right shoe, crossed the laces right over left, and bad the first bunny ear loop with the right side. 
You might be asking, "So what?"

Well, a couple of weeks ago, I started examining my automatic habits. This isn't new to me. I do this type of self-inventory periodically. This time, though, I decided to reach way back into and see if I could retrain a habit as fundamental as putting on my shoes. 

Do I need to change how I put on my shoes? Probably not. But, this practice helps me to become more aware of my habits and strengthens my ability to build new mental pathways. So much of how we move through life is shaped by these ingrained routines. Why not shake things up? 

It felt clumsy at first, but it's getting easier as new neural pathways form in my brain. Today, though, I caught myself slipping back into autopilot with ease. It's a good reminder of how autopilot can take control of our actions and that when building or rebuilding a habit you don't have to give up just because you messed up one time.
